# Linear-regression-with-gradient-descent
 
- Linear regression with gradient descent is a statistical approach used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference between the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable.
- Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In the context of linear regression, it is used to find the values of the coefficients (slope and intercept) that minimize the sum of squared errors between the actual and predicted values.

This repository gives an analysis of performance of linear regression models with the approaches - sklearn library, mathematical formula and gradient descent.

## Requirements

To run the linear regression analysis, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

## How to Use the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git](https://github.com/iabhiroop/Linear-regression-with-gradient-descent.git)
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the required libraries by running:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. **Run and Explore:** Test the variation of of the line of best fit and accuracy of predictions using all the variations.
